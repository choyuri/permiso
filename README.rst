Permiso: RBACish abstraction library for Erlang
===============================================

Permiso provides an abstract api and pluggable implementations for that api,
built in support for ets, dets, riak_core_security and ldap provided, more
implementations can be added by creating a new module that implements the
permiso behaviour.

The API is inspired by the `Snarl Protocol <https://github.com/project-fifo/snarl>`_
with some modifications.
